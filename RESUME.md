In the Customer Journey Success (CJS) league, where the mission was to provide the best customer service experience, I collaborated with the development and maintenance of tools for account management, advertising, payments and the help center.

### Internet Programmer / Developer Analyst 
>##### Boa Diversão Promoção e Entretenimento Ltda · Full time
>_dec 2008 - mar 2022 · 13 years 4 months_ <br>
>_Rio de Janeiro, Brazil · On site_

GBD Entretenimento is a group of successful companies that includes Ingresso Certo, Boa Diversão, Surf Connect and Go Content.

Ingresso Certo (www.ingressocerto.com) is a company specialized in ticket management and sales, operating both online and in physical stores through points of sale. As an analyst and developer, I collaborated in the design, development and maintenance of almost all of the company's systems, including ERP, e-Commerce, POS, fraud analysis, security and access control. One of the biggest problems was payments canceled by card operators (chargebacks). In addition to solving problems with customers, the customer service team was specialized in identifying profiles of fraudulent users. Together with the team, I was responsible for creating intelligence and automated analysis processes capable of identifying profiles and issuing alerts in the order management system. This increased the team's productivity and assertiveness by 80%, preventing major losses for the company.

Boa Diversão (www.boadiversao.com.br) is a portal and information guide about parties, events, shows and gastronomy in Rio de Janeiro. As an analyst and developer, I collaborated in the design, development and implementation of the new CMS and the portal's frontend, which had integrations and actively exchanged information with the Ingresso Certo sales platform and digital marketing platforms, such as RD Station. When redesigning the frontend, I took the initiative to promote and implement the "mobile first" concept, which, combined with SEO techniques, increased PageRank and made the portal's pages appear in the first results of search engines, generating a considerable increase in organic traffic.

Surf Connect (www.surfconnect.com.br) is a platform for monitoring and forecasting weather conditions for water sports. As an analyst and developer, I collaborated on the design, development and implementation of a new CMS and frontend, which has integrations with streaming services, meteorology and payment gateways, as well as automation for updating forecasts, renewing subscriptions and recurring billing. I noticed that some users had the behavior of viewing multiple cameras at the same time, so I designed and implemented the Multispot tool, which was made available to subscribers.

Go Content (www.gocontent.com.br) is a company specialized in digital marketing. As an analyst and developer, I was responsible for the integrations between all lead capture systems and platforms used.

### Automation Systems Analyst / Developer (Full Stack)
>##### Produto Editorial Comunicação Ltda · Full time
>_apr 2008 - dec 2008 · 9 months_ <br>
>_Rio de Janeiro, Brazil · On site_

I was responsible for maintaining the web and network servers. I developed the intranet and improved internal processes for publishing the sports journal, creating a solution for automating the generation of PDF files and sending them to the printer via FTP, using Adobe tools such as Distiller.

In addition to user support, server maintenance and process automation, I developed and implemented new features on the Jornal dos Sports portal, such as polls, discussions and sharing, using MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Support / Developer
>##### RCR Informática Ltda · Full time
>_aug 2007 - may 2008 · 10 months_ <br>
>_Rio de Janeiro, Brazil · On site_

I provided support to users, and occasionally carried out technical visits and training for customers to use the systems.

I collaborated with the development and maintenance of solutions aimed at educational institutions, academic control, content portal, student portal, online bulletin and others. In addition, I also collaborated with the creation of advertising pieces and customization of layouts.

### Systems Development Analyst (Full Stack)
>##### Editora dos Esportes SPA XXI LTDA · Full time
>_dec 2005 - aug 2007 · 1 year 9 months_ <br>
>_Rio de Janeiro, Brazil · On site_

Initially, I provided support to network users, maintained computers and printers in the newsroom, and monitored the publication process of the sports daily. After this period, working as a web developer, I was responsible for the complete reformulation of the Jornal dos Sports website, from the conception of the new visual communication to the design, development, and implementation of a new CMS, using MySQL, PHP, HTML (Tableless), CSS, and JavaScript.

After the redesign, where I also used SEO techniques, the portal went from 500k to 3m page views per month, which led to a partnership with the provider UOL. This partnership consisted of making the portal's content available on UOL's pages, and when an article was featured on the home page, the site would experience peaks in simultaneous accesses that would degrade the server. The biggest challenge was to create a solution that would prevent this degradation, and at that time, there was not much talk about caching, since most websites on the internet were static. That was when I developed a "cache" system that generated static HTML files of the newspaper's dynamic portal pages.

### The Importance of Encouraging Research into Internet Solutions for UFRRJ
>##### XXVIII CNMAC · sep 12 2005

The National Congress of Applied and Computational Mathematics (CNMAC) is an event that takes place annually, promoted by the Brazilian Society of Applied and Computational Mathematics (SBMAC), and which brings together researchers, professors and students from all over Brazil to talk about technology-related projects developed in the institutions.

As a member of NDWEB, I participated in the development of portals for several institutes at UFRuralRJ, collaborating in the computerization and automation of processes for obtaining documents and authorizations by university students.

The perception of the importance of this work by all members of the development group made us want to share the experience and results, which gave rise to the project to be presented at the congress.
